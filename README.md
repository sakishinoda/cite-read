# Cite Read

## Core Method
1. Parse out `/cite` and `/citep` tags from TeX files per section (or any arbitrary level of hierarchy in the underlying text)
2. Match the citations to bibliography entries
3. Gather statistics at the (sub-)section level about the relevance of each of the bibliography entries through frequency; expose the context in which the references occur
4. Present results in a nice format

## Extensions
1. Link up directly to the Arxiv S3 to retrieve TeX and other components
